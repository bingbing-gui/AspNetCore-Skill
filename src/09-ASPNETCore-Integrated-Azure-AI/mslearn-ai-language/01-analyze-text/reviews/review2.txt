Tired hotel with poor service
The Royal Hotel, London, United Kingdom
5/6/2018
This is a old hotel (has been around since 1950's) and the room furnishings are average - becoming a bit old now and require changing. The internet didn't work and had to come to one of their office rooms to check in for my flight home. The website says it's close to the British Museum, but it's too far to walk.
