Good location and helpful staff, but on a busy road.
The Lombard Hotel, San Francisco, USA
8/16/2018
We stayed here in August after reading reviews. We were very pleased with location, just behind Chestnut Street, a cosmopolitan and trendy area with plenty of restaurants to choose from. The
Marina district was lovely to wander through, very interesting houses. Make sure to walk to the San Francisco Museum of Fine Arts and the Marina to get a good view of Golden Gate bridge and the city. On a bus route and easy to get into centre. Rooms were clean with plenty of room and staff were friendly and helpful. The only down side was the noise from Lombard Street so ask to have a room furthest away from traffic noise.
